##**Prerequisites**
* Some programming experience. The code here is pretty simple, but it helps to know something about functions.
* A tool to edit your code. Any text editor you have will work fine. Most text editors have good support for Go. The most popular are VSCode (free), GoLand (paid), and Vim (free).
* A command terminal. Go works well using any terminal on Linux and Mac, and on PowerShell or cmd in Windows.

**Install Go**

* Just use the [Download and install](https://go.dev/doc/install) steps.
